0x1D. C - Binary trees

Learning objectives for this project:

	-What is a binary tree
	-What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
	-What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
	-What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
	-What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
	-What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

Tasks:

	-0:function that creates a binary tree node
	-1:function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node
	-2:function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node
	-function that deletes an entire binary tree
	-function that checks if a node is a leaf
	-function that checks if a given node is a root
	-function that goes through a binary tree using pre-order traversal
	-function that goes through a binary tree using in-order traversal
	-function that goes through a binary tree using post-order traversal
	-function that measures the height of a binary tree
	-function that measures the depth of a node in a binary tree
	-function that measures the size of a binary tree
	-function that counts the leaves in a binary tree
	-function that counts the nodes with at least 1 child in a binary tree
	-function that measures the balance factor of a binary tree
	-function that checks if a binary tree is full
	-function that checks if a binary tree is perfect
	-function that finds the sibling of a node
	-function that finds the uncle of a node
